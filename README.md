# Cross-Domain Inductive Applications with Unsupervised Dynamic Graph Neural Networks
This project aims to develope pretrained GNN model which learn parameters in unsupervised settings on a smaller graphs. In this project unsupervised learning framework based on Siamese Neural network is presented which can learn the parameters on smaller graphs. Further the model is applied to generate node embedding for bigger graphs.
