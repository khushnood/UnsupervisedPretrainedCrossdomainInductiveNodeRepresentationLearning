# Cross-Domain Inductive Applications with Unsupervised Dynamic Graph Neural Networks
This project aims to develope pretrained GNN model which learn parameters in unsupervised settings on a smaller graphs. In this project unsupervised learning framework based on Siamese Neural network is presented which can learn the parameters on smaller graphs. Further the model is applied to generate node embedding for bigger graphs.

Abstract: 
The existing body of work in graph embedding has mainly focused on GNN models that work on transduction settings, meaning the model can be used only for the graph on which it has been trained. This limitation restricts the applicability of GNN models, as training them on large graphs is a very expensive process. Furthermore, there is a research gap in applying these models to cross-domain inductive prediction, where training on a single smaller graph and using it on larger or different domain graphs is desired. Therefore, considering these problems, this study aims to propose a novel GNN model that not only works on inductively generating node representations within the same domain but also across different domains. To evaluate the performance of our models, we have used four real-world dynamic graphs. Additionally, we have trained our model on a smaller dataset in an unsupervised manner. The pretrained model is then used to generate inter- and intra-domain graph node representations. Our framework is robust, as any state-of-the-art GNN method can be utilized to exploit the Siamese neural network framework and learn parameters based on the proposed energy-based cost.
